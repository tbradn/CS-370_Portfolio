Project Overview
This repository contains my implementation of a deep Q-learning algorithm for an intelligent pirate agent in a treasure hunt game. The project demonstrates the application of reinforcement learning and neural networks to solve a pathfinding problem in a maze environment.
Project Work Summary
Given Code
I was provided with substantial starter code that formed the foundation of the project:

TreasureMaze.py: A complete environment class that handles maze mechanics, state management, reward calculation, and visualization
GameExperience.py: An experience replay system that stores episodes and manages the agent's memory for learning
Neural Network Architecture: A pre-built model using Keras with two hidden layers, PReLU activations, and Adam optimizer
Helper Functions: Utility functions for gameplay simulation, completion checking, and time formatting
Jupyter Notebook Structure: A well-organized notebook with explanatory text and code blocks

Code I Created
My primary contribution was implementing the core Q-training algorithm (qtrain function), which required:

Epsilon-greedy exploration strategy: Balancing random exploration with exploitation of learned knowledge
Experience collection loop: Managing the agent's interaction with the environment across training epochs
Valid action filtering: Ensuring the agent only considers legal moves based on maze constraints
Neural network training integration: Connecting the experience replay system with the model training process
Performance monitoring: Tracking win rates, loss metrics, and automatically adjusting exploration parameters
Convergence detection: Implementing logic to stop training when optimal performance is achieved

The implementation required understanding how reinforcement learning components interact: environment states, action selection, reward processing, and iterative model improvement through experience replay.
Connection to Computer Science
What Computer Scientists Do and Why It Matters
Computer scientists develop algorithmic solutions to complex problems, create systems that can process information intelligently, and design technologies that extend human capabilities. This project exemplifies several core aspects of computer science work:
Problem Abstraction: I transformed a navigation challenge into a mathematical framework using Markov Decision Processes, demonstrating how computer scientists abstract real-world problems into computable forms.
Algorithm Design: The Q-learning implementation showcases how computer scientists create systematic approaches to learning and decision-making that can outperform traditional rule-based programming.
System Integration: Combining neural networks, experience replay, and reinforcement learning principles illustrates how computer scientists build complex systems from multiple components.
This work matters because it represents the foundation of autonomous systems, from robotics to game AI to resource optimization. The techniques used here scale to applications like autonomous vehicle navigation, supply chain optimization, and adaptive user interfaces.
My Approach as a Computer Scientist
When approaching this pathfinding problem, I applied systematic computer science methodologies:
Problem Decomposition: I broke down the complex challenge into manageable components like environment interaction, learning mechanism, action selection, and performance evaluation.
Mathematical Modeling: I implemented the Bellman equation for Q-value updates, understanding how mathematical principles translate into code that enables learning behavior.
Iterative Development: I built the solution incrementally, testing each component and understanding how parameters like epsilon, learning rate, and replay buffer size affect performance.
Empirical Analysis: I monitored training metrics to understand convergence patterns and adjust hyperparameters based on observed behavior rather than assumptions.
Algorithmic Thinking: I considered computational efficiency, memory management, and scalability when implementing the experience replay system and neural network training loop.
This approach demonstrates how computer scientists combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation skills, using data-driven decision making to optimize system performance.
Ethical Responsibilities
Working on AI systems like this intelligent agent raises important ethical considerations for both end users and organizations:
Transparency and Explainability: While the neural network learns effective strategies, its decision-making process lacks transparency. As a computer scientist, I have a responsibility to acknowledge these limitations and consider when explainable AI approaches might be more appropriate, especially in high-stakes applications.
Bias and Fairness: The agent's learning is entirely dependent on the training environment and reward structure I designed. This highlights the responsibility to ensure training data and reward systems don't perpetuate harmful biases when applied to real-world scenarios.
Safety and Reliability: The epsilon-greedy exploration strategy means the agent occasionally takes random actions. In safety-critical applications, I would need to implement additional safeguards and thoroughly test edge cases to prevent harmful outcomes.
Privacy and Data Use: The experience replay system stores detailed interaction histories. In real applications involving human users, I would need to consider data privacy, consent, and secure handling of behavioral information.
Societal Impact: Autonomous decision-making systems can affect employment, resource distribution, and human agency. I have a responsibility to consider these broader implications and advocate for responsible deployment of AI technologies.
Continuous Learning: As the field evolves, I must stay informed about best practices, emerging ethical frameworks, and potential misuse of AI technologies to ensure my work contributes positively to society.
Technical Reflection
This project reinforced several key computer science concepts:

The power of combining multiple AI techniques (neural networks + reinforcement learning)
How mathematical theory (Bellman equations) translates into practical algorithms
The importance of balancing exploration and exploitation in learning systems
The role of proper software architecture in creating maintainable AI systems

The experience also highlighted the iterative nature of AI development, where performance emerges through careful tuning of multiple interdependent parameters rather than explicit programming of desired behaviors.
